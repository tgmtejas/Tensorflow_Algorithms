# TensorFlow Algorithms:
These are custom made code files intended to learn basics of machine learning and Deep learning algorithms. Code has been written without help of in-built TensorFlow functions to compute cost, gradients and fitting of model.

Part A: Machine Learning  
1) Prob_1 ==> Linear regression
2) Prob_2 ==> Polynomial Regression with Regularization
3) Prob_3 ==> Logistic Regression
